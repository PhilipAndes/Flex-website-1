# Flex-website-1

Started coding: dec, 2018. 

After 1 month of learning, I started my bootcamp beginning january 2019 at CodeGorilla, Breda. 

Here we learned about flexbox the first week, so I decided to apply it to a new project. 

I ve made this website in one day just to see the usecase of flexbox.

It works really handy I think and it is easy to make websites responsive with the wrap method.
